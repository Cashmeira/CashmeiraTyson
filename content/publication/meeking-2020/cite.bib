 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal social interactions, 
 impaired language, and stereotypic and repetitive behaviours. Among genetically susceptible subpopulations, gut and dietary influences may play a role in etiology. 
 Propionic acid (PPA), produced by enteric gut bacteria, crosses both the gut-blood and the blood-brain barrier. 
 Previous research has demonstrated that repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions of PPA in adult rats produce behavioural and neuropathological changes similar to those seen in ASD patients, 
 including hyperactivity, stereotypy, and repetitive movements. The current study examined dose and time related changes of exploratory and repetitive behaviours with the use of the hole-board task. 
 Adult male Long-Evans rats received ICV infusions twice a day, 4 h apart, of either buffered PPA (low dose 0.052 M or high dose 0.26 M, pH 7.5, 4 $μ$L/infusion) 
 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M) for 7 consecutive days. Locomotor activity and hole-poke behaviour were recorded daily in an automated open field apparatus (Versamax), equipped with 16 open wells, 
 for 30 min immediately after the second infusion. In a dose dependent manner PPA infused rats displayed significantly more locomotor activity, stereotypic behaviour and nose-pokes than PBS infused rats. 
 Low-dose PPA animals showed locomotor activity levels similar to those of PBS animals at the start of the infusion schedule, but gradually increased to levels comparable to those of high-dose PPA animals
  by the end of the infusion schedule, demonstrating a dose and time dependent effect of the PPA treatments.},
